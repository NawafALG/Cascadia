## Gameplay Overview
In Cascadia, players take turns building their own terrain areas using hexagonal habitat tiles. Each turn, you select a new habitat tile, each paired with a corresponding wildlife token. These tiles are strategically placed adjacent to existing tiles in your terrain area, while the wildlife tokens find their homes on suitable habitats. The game offers a blend of strategy and decision-making. You'll strive to create interconnected habitats to reduce fragmentation and establish wildlife corridors. Your objective is to have the largest areas of each habitat type, with the opportunity for bonuses if your areas surpass those of your fellow players.

Wildlife Strategy
A key element of Cascadia is the placement of wildlife tokens. Your success hinges on aligning wildlife with their preferred habitats to maximize your point potential. Scoring is determined by random criteria outlined in wildlife-specific scoring cards. For instance, certain wildlife might seek isolation from their kind, while others thrive in the company of diverse animals. The challenge lies in deciphering these preferences and arranging your terrain area accordingly.

Nature Tokens
As you navigate the delicate balance of habitat and wildlife, nature tokens offer a strategic advantage. Spend these tokens to choose your preferred habitat tiles and wildlife tokens, granting you greater control over your approach and enhancing your tactical gameplay.
